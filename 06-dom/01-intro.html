<!-- //document.getElementById("id")

//textcontent = displays all the content, either hidden or not hidden, from the tag
//innerHTML = displays all the content of the tag. including nested tags, in html itself
//innertext = just displays the content of the tag diaplayed on the screen 

//document.querySelector('h1')  = used for tags
//document.querySelector(#title)  = used for id
//document.querySelector(.header)  = used for class


//getElementById() are essential methods for the selecting elements from the DOM
//querySelector() offers more flexibility with the CSS selectors getElementById() is optimized for the selecting elements by their IDs providing better performance.

//querySelectorAll returns either a NodeList or HTML collection. these are not arrays.
//to perform any operation of arrays need to be converted into arryas. like - const convertedArray = Array.from(NodeListName);
//now, you can perform anything on convertedArray

//operations of NodeListand HTMLcollection are limited. can see from their prototype. -->
